## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to provide a tool for the user to be able to keep track of their item locations.
Because sometimes keeping track of your own items in your own room can also get difficult, especially the items
that are not frequently used. Also it could be a really helpful tool for smaller businesses that do not have a
professionally managed inventory system in place and would like to keep track of their items in a more organized way.
I also think it could be quite a helpful tool for example in supermarkets where if a person is looking for a specific
item, they could just search for the item they are looking for and the app would show them the exact location.

## Parts

### Login

The user will have to login to be able to fully use the app. It will make it possible to store the user's data so
the user does not lose their work.
Another reason for the login is that there will be a publicly available library of all the shapes, furniture and
floors other users have created if they choose to share it. Other less experienced users can then use the library to manage their own items.

### Shape Editor

Since it is difficult to supply all the shapes that the user might need, the user can create their own shapes.

### Floor Editor

The user should be able to create their own floors (top-down view). To these floors they can then add
the furniture they have created or selected from the library.

### Furniture Editor

The user should be able to create their own furniture. The user will use the shapes they have created or selected from
the library to create their own furniture. The user will be able to add "building block" shapes that only serve as a
structure for the furniture (walls, etc.), then they add the zones where items can be placed. The user will be creating
the front view of the furniture but the user will also have to specify the top-down view of the furniture so it can be
placed on the floor.

### Item Management

The user should be able to query the location of an item. The user should also be able to add, remove and move items
from one furniture to another.

### Overall Management

The user should be able to manage all the floors, furniture they have created.
